1. create a react project using next bootstrap
	npx create-next-app app-name --ts
	no eslint if asked, it will be installed separately
2. installing ts-jest
	go their npm repo and then click the link homepage
	when navigated to the homepage, click get started and in the left panel click installation
	npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
3. go further down in the homepage you'll see instruction how to initialize your project with ts-jest
	npx ts-jest config:init
	this will create jest.config.js file
4. create an 'src' folder and move the 'pages' folder inside it
5. create components folder and inside it create simple ts file with simple function
	inside the same folder, create {1st_file_name}.spec.ts for your testing
6. perform some testing on your simple function and also some testing about types
7. install react testing library
	go to the documentation, google 'react testing library'
	npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom
8. once installed, create a simple component and it's testing file and see that it shows an error
9. to fix the error
	at the root, create tsconfig.jest.json and modify as in the project file
	this tsconfig.jest.json will  not be used yet until you instruc jest to use it
		modify jest.config.js as in the project file
	this will produce a different error this is because in jest.confi.js, the testenvironment=node needs to be changed
		change it to 'jsdom' after installing pagckage 'jest-environment-jsdom'
		this way the test execution will be executed in an emulated environment
10. Now functions like expect(element).toBeInTheDocument() will not be recognized yet
	this is not ootb included in the jest functions but extended by jest-dom
	what you need to do is instruct jest by updating 'jest-config.js' and add setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./src/setup-jest.ts']
		next is you need to add that file to the correct location and put 'import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
